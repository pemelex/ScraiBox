# ScraiBox Project State (.scbs)

## Current Focus
- Implementing the Use Case plugin system and Inventory scanning.
- Setting up the "Self-Hydration" mechanism.

## Decisions Made
- Architecture: Plugin-based, direct DI, NOT Event-Driven.
- Tech Stack: .NET 10, MAUI/WASM GUI.
- Use-case plugins for smart context aggregation.
- Projects: ScraiBox.Core.Interfaces (DTOs), ScraiBox.Plugin.* (Logic).
- Storage: Use "Inventory" for file mapping to avoid full-tree scans.

## Recent Files (Current Context)
- `Home.razor` (GUI and Use Case integration)
- `SelfHydrationUseCase.cs` (Plugin logic)
- `InventoryService.cs` (File scanning logic)
- `ScraiBoxContext.cs` & `ScraiBoxResult.cs` (Core DTOs)

## Status
- Core infrastructure for plugins is alive.
- First system plugin (Hydration) is functional.
- Next: Connect Inventory to GUI for autocomplete.

## Pending Tasks
1. [ ] Finalize InventoryService registration in GUI. Auto-complete for Use Case targets.
2. [ ] Create a UI panel for selecting and running Use Cases.
3. [ ] Implement Roslyn-based context aggregator.

## Instructions for AI");
- Please acknowledge this context and use the `scry` commands to explore files as needed.
- Do not suggest event-driven patterns. Use the defined ScraiBoxContext and ScraiBoxResult.
