# ScraiBox Project State (.scbs)

## Decisions Made
- Architecture: Plugin-based, direct DI, NOT Event-Driven.
- Tech Stack: .NET 10, MAUI/WASM GUI.
- Use-case plugins for smart context aggregation.
- Storage: Use InventoryService for file mapping to avoid full-tree scans.
- Solution Analysis: Use RoslynService for intelligent code analysis.

## Recent Files (Current Context)
- `Home.razor` (GUI and Use Case integration)
- `DeepContextTracerUseCase.cs` (Plugin for collecting deep method call tree)
- `InventoryService.cs` (File scanning logic)
- `RoslynService.cs` (GetUsedTypeNamesAsync, GetMethodCallsAsync, GetMethodSourceCodeAsync)
- `ScraiBoxContext.cs` & `ScraiBoxResult.cs` (Core DTOs)

## Status
- Core infrastructure for plugins is alive.
- Some plugins (SelfHydrationUseCase, BlazorComponentEditUseCase) are functional. DeepContextTracerUseCase needs some debugging.
- Next: WinForms UI?

## Pending Tasks
1. [ ] Make the DeepContextTracerUseCase functional.
2. [ ] Create WinForms UI as the MAUI is too heavy weight and slow.
3. [ ] Implement saving of output to file.
3. [ ] Implement more UseCases.

## Instructions for AI");
- Please acknowledge this context and use the `scry` commands to explore files as needed.
- Do not suggest event-driven patterns. Use the defined ScraiBoxContext and ScraiBoxResult.
